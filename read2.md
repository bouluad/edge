# JFrog Edge Overview

JFrog Edge is a specialized version of JFrog Artifactory designed to extend DevOps processes to edge locations, ensuring seamless delivery and management of artifacts across distributed environments. It is tailored for organizations with a centralized setup that also require efficient artifact management at remote or regional locations.

## Key Features of JFrog Edge

1. **Read-Only Artifacts:**
   - JFrog Edge nodes are designed for artifact distribution. They host a subset of artifacts from a central JFrog Platform but do not support artifact modification or creation locally.

2. **Efficient Artifact Distribution:**
   - Uses replication mechanisms to ensure that only required artifacts are pushed from a central instance to the edge node. This reduces bandwidth usage and improves efficiency.

3. **Optimized Performance for Remote Teams:**
   - Local caching of artifacts reduces latency for developers in remote locations accessing frequently used components.

4. **Scalability and High Availability:**
   - Supports multiple edge nodes to cover different geographic areas, scaling with business needs.

5. **Integration with JFrog Pipelines:**
   - Ensures CI/CD processes seamlessly deliver builds to edge locations for deployment or testing.

6. **Security and Compliance:**
   - Includes robust access control and artifact governance policies to ensure that only authorized artifacts are distributed.

7. **Replication Types:**
   - Supports event-based and scheduled replication to synchronize artifacts.

## How to Use JFrog Edge

1. **Installation:**
   - Deploy the JFrog Edge node using standard installation methods (Docker, Kubernetes, or on-premise VMs).
   - Configure it via the JFrog Platform UI or using configuration files/scripts.

2. **Set Up Replication:**
   - Configure replication jobs in the central Artifactory instance to sync specific repositories or artifacts to the edge node.
   - Set policies for event-based or scheduled replication depending on your requirements.

3. **Repository Setup:**
   - Define which repositories will be available on the edge node.
   - Use remote repositories for artifacts not stored locally but needed on demand.

4. **Access Control:**
   - Manage permissions using roles and users to ensure that edge nodes adhere to security policies.

5. **Artifact Usage:**
   - Artifacts accessed via the edge node are read-only and cached for efficiency.

6. **Monitoring:**
   - Use JFrog Mission Control and insights tools to monitor replication, usage, and node health.

## JFrog Edge Architecture

The architecture typically follows a **hub-and-spoke model**:

### 1. Central JFrog Platform (Hub)
   - Acts as the central repository where all artifact management and CI/CD processes are centralized.
   - Includes a full Artifactory instance capable of managing, storing, and building artifacts.

### 2. JFrog Edge Nodes (Spokes)
   - Deployed at various geographic or functional locations.
   - Replicated artifacts from the central hub are available here.
   - Configured for read-only access with local caching.

### 3. Replication Mechanism
   - Push-based or pull-based replication to sync artifacts from the central instance to edge nodes.
   - Can be event-driven or scheduled.

### 4. User Access
   - Local users interact with the edge node, accessing artifacts with reduced latency.
   - Requests for artifacts not available locally are routed to the central hub.

### 5. Networking
   - Secure communication channels between the central instance and edge nodes.
   - May include load balancers or gateways for distributed access.
